# JavaScript-Quiz
Homework #4
In this homework assignment I was able to follow most of the acceptance criteria. The main thing that I struggled with was the saving a score portion of the quiz. I was able to complete everything else. However, my paths to my js and css were messing up. I tried to fix them but I don't know if that happened. 

As soon as you open the link you should be brought to a start page. 
Once you click start, you will be given 60 seconds to complete the 10 question quiz.
You have 10 seconds to answer each question.
Wrong answers will subtract time from your overall 60 seconds and each question is worth 10 points.
